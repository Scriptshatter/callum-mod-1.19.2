Variables:
GSON (a deserializer for converting JSON to a class/variable)

Functions:
OriginManager (constructs the manager. takes in a deserializer and a "dataType")

apply (basically registers all origins by taking every origin with the same ID, and compairing their load priorities.
If the origin is disabled, it removes it from the registry. It then adds all the powers to the origin from the registry. If a power is disabled, it removes it.
If the config has been changed, it basically re-registerd it for the server, and only the server. This is why if you use /reload you have to re-select your origin.)

getFabricId (uhh... Just return the ID of the mod and what kind of stuff your registering I guess?)

getFabricDependencies (Uhmmm... return the IDs of what other DataLoaders your using. That's my best guess.)
